# InChat
APP INNOVATION CHALLENGE

# INTRODUCTION:
Social media is meant to be primarily a bridge between a person's personal and social life, which most apps fail to provide. But, in this day and age social networking has become a platform for major software giants to drain the time of its users to the last bit, not considering their sociological health. This is where our project comes in to try make a change. 

# OUR VISION:
		  This Application (InChat, The way India Chats) aims to radically change the way we live our social lives. This application is developed using Flutter, so it can be published for iOS and Android with ease. The fact that it is developed using Flutter cuts the development time in half and enhances the reach of the application. We concentrate mainly on the users’ well-being by always keeping an eye out on how they are feeling. 

# THE BASICS:
		InChat ticks all the features most of the Chatting applications bring, like Text messaging, Read Receipts, Voice calls, Video calls, group video calls upto 6 members, multimedia messaging and a couple of mini games to play with our friends.

# THE UNIQUE FEATURES:

# Personalized Daily Surveys:
  InChat takes daily surveys on how the users’ feel about the day. It records the results and provides a weekly or monthly report on the users’ happiness using eye catching visual representation. The survey takes place daily before bedtime, which will be gotten from the user.
Personalized Splash-Screen - InChat can display messages on the splash screen depending upon the user’s emotional state, simple but effective words can make a change in a person’s day.

# Push Notifications when needed:
  The users can select up-to 10 close friends. And when a user records a bad day for any reason, it is brought to their (close friends) knowledge by a push notification, so that they can contact them and make them feel better.

# Personal Blog:
  The users can take a note on their daily life in the app, which acts as a Gallery of their Life, more like a personal, digital Diary.

# News Feed:
  InChat displays some handpicked headlines which acts as a breath of fresh air, making the users think apart from social media and imparting knowledge at the same time.

# Text Memos:
  InChat enables the users to send each other text memos, which can be decided to be displayed publicly or exclusively to the user it is aimed at. This could bring back the fashion of writing personal letters, but in a different way.

# SECURITY:
		InChat provides multiple options when it comes to security such as local encrypted storage for messages and private media content, and a private online backup system so that we do not lose our messages to anyone or when switching devices. The local storage follows 8  bit encryption methods for extreme safety.

# CONCLUSION:
		Hence, InChat not only being a chat application, it also seconds as an everyday companion for its users and helps them have a healthy balance between social and personal lives.
